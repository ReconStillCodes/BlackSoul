                    A prodigy of a lost dance style, their movements once held a mystical grace that could revitalize the weary and even heal the wounded. However, a terrible plague twisted their art, transforming their graceful steps into a deadly ballet. Now, they flit through ruined cities, their dances a macabre performance that saps the life from those who witness it. The character is unsure if they are a harbinger of doom or a mercy killer, putting the afflicted out of their misery in the only way they know how.

                    Once a promising young mage, they delved into forbidden texts, their hunger for knowledge outweighing caution. They unearthed secrets that corrupted their magic, twisting it into a chaotic and destructive force. Shunned by their former colleagues, they now wander the land, a solitary figure cloaked in shadows, wielding their warped magic as they seek a way to undo the damage they unleashed.

                    Clad in heavy armor etched with penitential prayers, this warrior is haunted by a past transgression. Perhaps they served a tyrannical king or slaughtered innocents in a fit of rage. Now, they wander the world, seeking redemption by vanquishing evil wherever they find it. Their weathered shield serves not only as defense but as a constant reminder of their past failures.
